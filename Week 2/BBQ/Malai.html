    <h1>Malai Boti</h1>

    <p>
      Malai boti is a popular Pakistani dish known for its creamy and tender
      grilled chicken. It is made by marinating boneless chicken pieces in a
      mixture of yogurt, cream, spices, and herbs, which gives it a rich and
      flavorful taste. To prepare malai boti, the chicken is cut into cubes or
      strips and then marinated in a mixture of yogurt, fresh cream (malai),
      ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, and a blend of spices such as cumin,
      coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The marinated chicken is left to
      absorb the flavors for several hours or overnight, allowing the spices to
      infuse into the meat. After marination, the chicken is typically skewered
      and grilled to perfection. The grilling process results in a juicy and
      succulent texture while also adding a slight char and smoky flavor. It can
      be cooked over a barbecue grill, in an oven, or on a stovetop grill pan.
      Malai boti is often served with naan bread, roti, or rice, and is
      accompanied by mint chutney, sliced onions, and lemon wedges. The creamy
      and aromatic chicken, combined with the subtle blend of spices, creates a
      delicious and indulgent dish that is loved by many. The creamy and tender
      nature of malai boti, along with its delightful flavors, makes it a
      popular choice for special occasions, family gatherings, and festive
      celebrations in Pakistan.

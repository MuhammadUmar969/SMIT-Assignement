    <h1>Chicken Quorma</h1>

    <p>
      Chicken qorma is a popular and flavorful dish in Pakistan. It consists of
      tender chicken pieces cooked in a creamy and spiced gravy. The chicken is
      marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked with caramelized onions, a
      blend of aromatic spices, and enriched with ingredients like cream and
      nuts. The slow cooking process results in a tender and flavorful chicken
      qorma that is often enjoyed with naan, rice, or roti as a main course dish
      for special occasions or family gatherings. Its creamy texture and
      delicious taste make it a favorite among Pakistani cuisine lovers.

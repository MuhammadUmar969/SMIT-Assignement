    <h1>Mutton Quorma</h1>

    <p>
      Mutton qorma is a flavorful and beloved dish in Pakistan. It features
      tender mutton (goat or lamb) cooked in a rich and aromatic gravy. The slow
      cooking process ensures that the mutton becomes tender and absorbs the
      flavors of the spices. To prepare mutton qorma, the mutton pieces are
      often marinated in a mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and a blend of
      spices. This marinade helps to enhance the tenderness of the meat and
      infuse it with the delicious flavors. In a cooking pot, caramelized onions
      are combined with the marinated mutton and a variety of aromatic spices,
      such as cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and coriander. These spices impart
      their distinctive aromas and flavors to the qorma, creating a rich and
      tantalizing gravy. The qorma gravy is further enriched with ingredients
      like tomato paste, ginger, and garlic paste, and sometimes a splash of
      cream to add a creamy texture. The slow cooking process allows the flavors
      to develop and the mutton to become tender and succulent. Mutton qorma is
      often garnished with fresh coriander leaves, fried onions, and a drizzle
      of ghee (clarified butter) for added richness and flavor. It is typically
      enjoyed with naan, rice, or roti, and is a popular choice for special
      occasions and festive gatherings. The combination of tender mutton,
      aromatic spices, and a luscious gravy makes mutton qorma a sought-after
      dish in Pakistani cuisine. Its rich and robust flavors make it a favorite
      among meat lovers, providing a hearty and satisfying meal option.

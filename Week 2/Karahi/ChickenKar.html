    <h1>Chicken Karahi</h1>

    <p>
      Chicken karahi is a delicious and flavorful dish that is widely enjoyed in
      Pakistan. It is a quintessential part of Pakistani cuisine and is known
      for its rich and aromatic taste. Chicken karahi is made by cooking chicken
      pieces in a thick and tangy tomato-based gravy, seasoned with a blend of
      spices and herbs. To prepare chicken karahi, the chicken is usually cooked
      in a karahi, a traditional cooking utensil. The dish starts by saut√©ing
      onions, ginger, and garlic in oil or ghee until they become golden brown.
      Then, the chicken pieces are added to the karahi and cooked until they are
      tender and juicy. A mixture of tomatoes, green chilies, and a combination
      of spices like cumin, coriander, and turmeric is added to create a robust
      and aromatic gravy. The dish is often garnished with fresh coriander
      leaves and served with naan or roti, making it a delightful meal that is
      enjoyed by many. Chicken karahi is loved for its bold flavors and the
      perfect balance of tanginess and spiciness. It is a go-to dish for
      gatherings, family dinners, and special occasions. The succulent chicken
      and the vibrant gravy make chicken karahi a popular choice among both
      locals and those who appreciate the flavors of Pakistani cuisine.

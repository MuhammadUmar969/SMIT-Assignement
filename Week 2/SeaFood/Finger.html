    <h1>Finger Fish</h1>

    <p>
      Finger fish, also known as fish fingers or fish strips, is a popular
      seafood appetizer enjoyed in Pakistan. It consists of boneless fish
      fillets that are marinated, coated in a seasoned batter, and deep-fried to
      a crispy golden brown. To prepare finger fish, boneless fish fillets, such
      as tilapia or cod, are commonly used. The fish fillets are cut into thin
      strips or bite-sized pieces for easy handling and quick cooking. The fish
      strips are then marinated with a mixture of spices, including red chili
      powder, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and salt. The marinade helps to infuse
      the fish with flavor and tenderize it. Next, the marinated fish pieces are
      coated with a batter made from a combination of flour, cornstarch, eggs,
      and various spices. The batter gives the fish a crispy and crunchy texture
      when fried. The fish strips are carefully dropped into hot oil and
      deep-fried until they turn golden brown and become crispy on the outside.
      It is important to fry them in small batches to ensure even cooking and
      prevent overcrowding in the fryer. Once cooked, the finger fish is
      typically served hot and garnished with fresh coriander leaves. It is
      commonly enjoyed as an appetizer or snack, served with a side of tangy
      tamarind chutney or mint yogurt sauce. The crispy and flavorful finger
      fish is a popular choice for seafood lovers in Pakistan. Its bite-sized
      portions and delightful taste make it a favorite appetizer or snack during
      gatherings, parties, or as a side dish with a main course.

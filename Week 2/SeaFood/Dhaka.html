    <h1>Dhakka Fish</h1>

    <p>
      In Dhakka Fish, fish fillets, such as Rui (Rohu) or Katla, are
      commonly used. The fish is marinated with a mixture of spices, including
      turmeric, red chili powder, cumin, coriander, ginger, garlic, and mustard
      oil. The marination helps to infuse the fish with a rich and aromatic
      flavor. To prepare the curry, a sauce is made by frying onions until
      golden brown and adding a combination of spices, such as cumin, coriander,
      turmeric, and chili powder. Tomatoes and green chilies are then added to
      the sauce, along with water or fish stock to create a flavorful base. The
      marinated fish fillets are gently placed into the simmering sauce and
      cooked until they are tender and fully cooked through. The fish absorbs
      the flavors of the spices and the tanginess from the tomatoes, creating a
      delicious and well-rounded dish. Dhakka Fish is typically served hot with
      steamed rice or naan bread. It is a popular choice among fish enthusiasts,
      as it combines the natural taste of the fish with a spicy and tangy curry
      that is characteristic of the Dhaka region. Please note that while Dhakka
      Fish may have influences and variations in neighboring regions, the
      specific recipe and preparation can vary among households and individual
      preferences.

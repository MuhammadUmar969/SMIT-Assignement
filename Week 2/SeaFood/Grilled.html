    <h1>Grilled Fish</h1>

    <p>
      Grilled fish is a popular and delicious dish enjoyed in Pakistan,
      particularly in coastal regions where fresh seafood is abundant. It is a
      simple yet flavorful preparation that allows the natural taste of the fish
      to shine. To prepare grilled fish, a whole fish, such as pomfret, trout,
      or snapper, is commonly used. The fish is first cleaned and scaled, and
      then marinated with a mixture of spices, including red chili powder,
      turmeric, cumin, coriander, and salt. Lemon juice or yogurt may also be
      added to the marinade for added tanginess and tenderness. The marinated
      fish is then placed on a grill or barbecue, either directly on the grates
      or in a grilling basket, and cooked over medium heat. The fish is
      typically grilled until it is cooked through, with a crispy and slightly
      charred exterior. During grilling, the fish is often basted with oil or
      melted butter to keep it moist and to enhance the flavors. The basting
      also helps to prevent the fish from sticking to the grill. Grilled fish is
      often served hot off the grill, accompanied by a side of mint chutney or
      tamarind chutney for added flavor. It is typically enjoyed with naan bread
      or rice, and may be served with a fresh salad or vegetable side dish. The
      smoky and charred flavors of grilled fish, along with the blend of spices,
      create a mouthwatering experience. It is a popular choice for seafood
      lovers in Pakistan, offering a delightful combination of simplicity and
      deliciousness.

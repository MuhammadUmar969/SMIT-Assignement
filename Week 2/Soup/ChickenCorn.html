    <h1>Chicken Corn Soup</h1>

    <p>
      Chicken corn soup is a popular and comforting soup enjoyed in Pakistan. It
      is a hearty and creamy soup that combines tender chicken pieces, sweet
      corn kernels, and a variety of seasonings to create a delicious and
      satisfying dish. To prepare chicken corn soup, boneless chicken is
      commonly used. The chicken is cooked separately in a pot with water, along
      with some salt and black pepper, until it becomes tender and fully cooked.
      Once cooked, the chicken is shredded or diced into small pieces. In a
      separate pot, chicken broth is heated, and sweet corn kernels are added.
      The corn kernels can be fresh or canned, depending on availability. The
      corn adds a touch of sweetness and a pleasant texture to the soup. To
      create the creamy consistency, a mixture of cornstarch and water, known as
      a slurry, is prepared. The slurry is added to the simmering broth, and the
      soup is stirred continuously until it thickens slightly. This helps to
      give the soup a smooth and velvety texture. Seasonings such as salt, white
      pepper, and soy sauce are added to enhance the flavor profile of the soup.
      Some variations may also include additional ingredients like finely
      chopped carrots, peas, or mushrooms for added color and texture. To finish
      the soup, beaten eggs are slowly drizzled into the pot while stirring
      gently. This creates delicate ribbons of cooked egg throughout the soup,
      adding visual appeal and a silky texture. Chicken corn soup is typically
      garnished with freshly chopped green onions or cilantro. It is served hot
      and enjoyed as a starter or a light meal. The combination of tender
      chicken, sweet corn, and creamy texture in chicken corn soup makes it a
      comforting and flavorful option. It is a beloved choice for soup
      enthusiasts in Pakistan, offering a satisfying and nourishing dish.

    <h1>Hot & Sour Soup</h1>

    <p>
      Hot and sour soup is a popular and flavorful dish enjoyed in Pakistan. It
      is a tangy and spicy soup that combines a variety of ingredients, creating
      a delightful balance of flavors. To prepare hot and sour soup, a
      combination of chicken or vegetables, such as mushrooms, carrots, and
      bamboo shoots, is commonly used. The ingredients are typically thinly
      sliced or chopped for easy consumption. In a pot, chicken or vegetable
      broth is heated, and the sliced ingredients are added. The soup is brought
      to a gentle boil, allowing the flavors to infuse into the broth. To create
      the distinctive hot and sour taste, vinegar, soy sauce, and chili sauce or
      crushed red pepper flakes are added to the soup. These ingredients provide
      the tangy and spicy elements that give the soup its characteristic flavor.
      To thicken the soup, a slurry made from cornstarch and water is often
      added. It helps to create a slightly thick and silky consistency. To
      further enhance the flavors, additional seasonings like garlic, ginger,
      and white pepper may be included. These ingredients add depth and
      complexity to the soup. Hot and sour soup is typically garnished with
      chopped green onions and a drizzle of sesame oil for added aroma and
      flavor. It is served hot and enjoyed as an appetizer or a comforting meal
      on its own. The combination of tangy vinegar, spicy chili, savory broth,
      and a medley of ingredients in hot and sour soup creates a satisfying and
      appetizing culinary experience. It is a popular choice for soup lovers in
      Pakistan, offering a delightful balance of flavors that awaken the taste
      buds.

    <h1>Thai Soup</h1>

    <p>
      Thai soup refers to a range of flavorful and aromatic soups that originate
      from Thai cuisine. They are known for their bold and harmonious blend of
      sweet, sour, salty, and spicy flavors. Two popular Thai soups are Tom Yum
      Soup and Tom Kha Soup. Tom Yum Soup is a hot and sour soup that typically
      features a combination of shrimp, chicken, or tofu, along with an
      assortment of herbs and spices. It is characterized by its tangy and zesty
      flavor profile, thanks to ingredients like lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves,
      galangal, lime juice, and Thai chili peppers. The soup may also include
      mushrooms, tomatoes, and cilantro, and is often served with a garnish of
      fresh herbs. Tom Kha Soup, also known as Coconut Soup, is a creamy and
      aromatic soup made with coconut milk as its base. It commonly includes
      chicken, but variations with shrimp or tofu are also popular. The soup is
      flavored with galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and Thai chili
      peppers, which infuse the broth with a delightful combination of tanginess
      and mild spiciness. The addition of coconut milk adds richness and
      creaminess to the soup, while mushrooms and cilantro add depth and
      freshness. Both Tom Yum and Tom Kha soups are typically served hot and are
      enjoyed as appetizers or as part of a main meal in Thai cuisine. They are
      often accompanied by steamed jasmine rice and are appreciated for their
      vibrant flavors and aromatic qualities.

      Chopped Salad is a vibrant and versatile salad that features a medley of
      finely chopped vegetables and other ingredients. It is a refreshing and
      nutritious dish that can be customized with a variety of ingredients based
      on personal preference. To prepare Chopped Salad, a selection of fresh
      vegetables is typically used. Common ingredients include lettuce,
      cucumbers, tomatoes, bell peppers, red onions, and carrots. These
      vegetables are washed, dried, and finely chopped into small, bite-sized
      pieces. In addition to the vegetables, other ingredients can be added to
      enhance the flavor and texture of the salad. This may include ingredients
      like diced avocado, crumbled feta cheese, olives, corn kernels, chickpeas,
      or grilled chicken or shrimp for added protein. Once all the ingredients
      are chopped and prepared, they are combined in a large bowl. The salad can
      be tossed together with a dressing of choice, such as a vinaigrette, ranch
      dressing, or even a citrus-based dressing for a tangy kick. Alternatively,
      individual portions of the chopped ingredients can be arranged neatly on a
      plate or in a salad bowl, allowing each person to customize their own
      dressing. Chopped Salad is known for its vibrant colors, crisp textures,
      and a delightful mix of flavors. It offers a satisfying balance of fresh
      vegetables and other ingredients, making it a wholesome and nutritious
      choice for a light meal or a side dish. Chopped Salad is versatile and can
      be adapted to suit different dietary preferences or dietary restrictions.
      It can be made vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free by selecting suitable
      ingredients and dressings. This salad is loved for its simplicity,
      versatility, and the way it showcases the natural flavors and textures of
      fresh vegetables. Chopped Salad provides a refreshing and healthy option

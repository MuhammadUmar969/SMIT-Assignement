    <h1>Russian Salad</h1>

    <p>
      Russian Salad, also known as Olivier Salad, is a popular and versatile
      dish that has gained popularity in various parts of the world, including
      Pakistan. It is a cold salad made with a combination of boiled potatoes,
      carrots, peas, and mayonnaise, along with other optional ingredients. To
      prepare Russian Salad, potatoes and carrots are boiled until tender, then
      peeled and diced into small cubes. Green peas, either fresh or canned, are
      also added to the mix. The diced vegetables are then combined in a bowl
      and mixed together. Mayonnaise is the key ingredient that binds the
      Russian Salad together. It is added to the bowl of vegetables and gently
      folded in until all the ingredients are coated with a creamy dressing. The
      amount of mayonnaise can be adjusted based on personal preference, to
      achieve the desired creaminess. Additional ingredients can be included to
      enhance the flavor and texture of the salad. These may include diced
      boiled eggs, pickles or gherkins, sweet corn kernels, finely chopped
      onions, and sometimes even diced ham or chicken for added protein. Once
      all the ingredients are combined, the Russian Salad is typically chilled
      in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving. This allows the
      flavors to meld together and the salad to become cool and refreshing.
      Russian Salad is commonly served as a side dish or appetizer, especially
      during festive occasions, picnics, or as part of a buffet spread. It is
      enjoyed for its creamy and tangy flavor, as well as its colorful
      presentation. The versatility of Russian Salad allows for variations in
      ingredients and flavors, making it a flexible dish that can be customized
      to individual tastes. It offers a delightful combination of creamy
      potatoes, crunchy vegetables, and a rich dressing, making it a popular
      choice among salad enthusiasts.

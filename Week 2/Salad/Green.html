    <h1>Lahori Green Salad</h1>

    <p>
      Lahori Green Salad is a refreshing and flavorful salad that originates
      from Lahore, a vibrant city in Pakistan known for its rich culinary
      traditions. It is a popular accompaniment to various Lahori dishes and
      offers a burst of freshness and crunch. To prepare Lahori Green Salad, a
      combination of fresh greens and vegetables are commonly used. The salad
      typically includes ingredients such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes,
      onions, and fresh coriander (cilantro) leaves. These ingredients are
      washed, chopped, and mixed together in a serving bowl. In addition to the
      greens and vegetables, the salad may also incorporate tangy elements such
      as green chili peppers and lemon juice. The green chili peppers add a
      spicy kick, while the lemon juice provides a zesty and acidic flavor that
      enhances the overall taste of the salad. To elevate the flavors, a
      sprinkle of salt and black pepper is added. Some variations of the Lahori
      Green Salad may include a drizzle of olive oil or a dash of chaat masala,
      a tangy and savory spice blend commonly used in Pakistani cuisine. Lahori
      Green Salad is versatile and can be customized based on personal
      preferences. Some individuals may choose to add additional ingredients
      like radishes, green bell peppers, or mint leaves for added freshness and
      variety. This vibrant and crisp salad is often served as a side dish
      alongside Lahori street food, barbecue dishes, or traditional Pakistani
      meals. Its refreshing nature helps balance out the flavors of the main
      course and provides a cooling element to the overall dining experience.
      Lahori Green Salad is cherished for its simplicity, vibrant colors, and
      the way it complements a wide range of dishes. Its combination of fresh
      greens, vegetables, and tangy accents make it a delightful and healthy
      addition to any meal.

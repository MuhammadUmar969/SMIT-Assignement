    <h1>Tandoori Roti</h1>

    <p>
      Tandoori roti is a traditional bread that is popular and widely
      enjoyed. It is made from a simple dough consisting of whole wheat flour,
      water, and a pinch of salt. The dough is kneaded until it becomes smooth
      and elastic, and then rolled into round discs. The unique characteristic
      of tandoori roti is that it is cooked in a tandoor, a traditional clay
      oven. The oven is heated to a high temperature, and the roti is slapped
      onto the inner wall of the tandoor, where it sticks and bakes. As it
      bakes, the roti puffs up and develops a slightly charred and smoky flavor.
      Tandoori roti is typically served hot and is a perfect accompaniment to
      various Indian dishes like curries, kebabs, and lentils. Its soft texture
      and smoky taste make it a favorite choice for those who appreciate the
      authentic flavors of Indian cuisine.

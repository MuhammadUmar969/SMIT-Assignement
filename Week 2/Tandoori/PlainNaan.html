    <h1>Plain Naan</h1>

    <p>
      Plain naan is a popular bread that is widely enjoyed for its soft
      and chewy texture. It is made from a simple dough consisting of
      all-purpose flour, water, yeast, sugar, and a pinch of salt. The dough is
      kneaded until it becomes smooth and then left to rise for some time. Once
      the dough has risen, it is divided into small portions and rolled out into
      oval or round shapes. The naan is then cooked in a tandoor or on a hot
      griddle, where it puffs up and develops a golden brown color. During the
      cooking process, the naan is brushed with ghee or butter to enhance its
      flavor and give it a slightly buttery taste. Plain naan is versatile and
      can be enjoyed with various dishes like curries, kebabs, and lentils. It
      can also be eaten on its own or used as a base for wraps or sandwiches.
      Its soft and fluffy texture, along with its delicious taste, makes plain
      naan a staple in Indian cuisine and a favorite choice among bread lovers.

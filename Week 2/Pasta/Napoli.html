    <h1>Spaghetti Napoli</h1>

    <p>
      Spaghetti Napoli, also known as Spaghetti alla Napoletana, is a classic
      Italian pasta dish that originated in Naples. It is a simple yet delicious
      preparation that showcases the flavors of a traditional tomato-based
      sauce. To prepare Spaghetti Napoli, spaghetti noodles are cooked until al
      dente, which means they are cooked until they are firm to the bite.
      Meanwhile, in a separate pan, a sauce is made using fresh tomatoes,
      garlic, olive oil, and a hint of red chili flakes for a touch of
      spiciness. The tomatoes are usually diced or crushed, and they are
      simmered with garlic in olive oil until they break down and release their
      juices. This creates a flavorful and vibrant tomato sauce. The addition of
      herbs like basil or oregano further enhances the taste and aroma of the
      sauce. Once the spaghetti noodles are cooked, they are drained and added
      to the pan with the tomato sauce. The noodles are tossed gently to coat
      them evenly with the sauce. The combination of the flavorful tomato sauce
      and the perfectly cooked pasta creates a delicious and satisfying dish.
      Spaghetti Napoli is often garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese
      and a sprinkle of chopped fresh basil or parsley. It is served hot and
      enjoyed as a main course, sometimes accompanied by a side of crusty bread
      or a simple green salad. This classic Italian dish showcases the
      simplicity and beauty of using fresh ingredients to create a flavorful and
      satisfying meal. Spaghetti Napoli is loved for its vibrant tomato sauce
      and the way it beautifully complements the texture of the spaghetti
      noodles.

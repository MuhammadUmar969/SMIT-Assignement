    <h1>Prawn Fried Rice</h1>

    <p>
      Prawn fried rice is a delightful and flavorful dish enjoyed in Pakistan.
      It combines the succulent taste of prawns with fragrant rice, vegetables,
      and aromatic spices, creating a satisfying and delicious meal. To prepare
      prawn fried rice, fresh prawns are cleaned and marinated in a mixture of
      soy sauce, ginger-garlic paste, and spices to infuse them with flavor. The
      marinated prawns are then cooked until they are tender and cooked through.
      In a separate pan, a combination of vegetables such as carrots, peas, bell
      peppers, and onions are stir-fried until they become crisp-tender. The
      cooked prawns are added to the pan along with cooked rice. The mixture is
      tossed together, allowing the flavors to blend well. To enhance the taste,
      soy sauce, oyster sauce, and other seasonings like black pepper and chili
      flakes are added to the dish. The rice is stir-fried until it is
      well-coated with the sauces and the flavors are evenly distributed. Prawn
      fried rice is typically garnished with fresh green onions or cilantro for
      a burst of freshness and aroma. It can be enjoyed as a standalone meal or
      served as a side dish alongside other Pakistani delicacies. The
      combination of tender prawns, fragrant rice, vibrant vegetables, and
      savory spices makes prawn fried rice a delightful choice in Pakistan. Its
      delicious flavors, enticing aroma, and satisfying textures make it a
      popular option for seafood lovers and those seeking a tasty and fulfilling
      meal.

    <h1>Kheer</h1>

    <p>
      Kheer, also known as rice pudding, is a traditional Pakistani dessert that
      is loved for its creamy and comforting taste. It is a popular sweet dish
      often made on special occasions and festivals. To prepare kheer, rice is
      cooked in milk until it becomes soft and tender. The rice is simmered in a
      mixture of milk and sugar, allowing it to absorb the flavors and become
      creamy. The slow cooking process ensures that the rice releases its
      starch, which helps thicken the kheer and gives it a rich consistency. In
      addition to rice and milk, kheer is often flavored with cardamom, saffron,
      and nuts such as almonds and pistachios. These ingredients are added to
      the simmering milk, infusing it with their aromatic and nutty flavors.
      Some variations of kheer may also include rose water, raisins, or grated
      coconut for added texture and taste. The cooking time for kheer can vary,
      but it typically takes a while to allow the rice to fully cook and the
      flavors to meld together. It is often stirred occasionally to prevent the
      rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan and to ensure even cooking.
      Kheer is usually served chilled or at room temperature. It can be
      garnished with a sprinkle of crushed nuts on top for added crunch and
      visual appeal. Some people also like to drizzle a bit of saffron-infused
      milk on the kheer to enhance its aroma and give it a beautiful golden
      color. Kheer is a comforting and indulgent dessert that is enjoyed by
      people of all ages. Its creamy texture, delicate flavors, and the subtle
      fragrance of cardamom and saffron make it a delightful treat that is often
      savored as a sweet ending to a meal or as a standalone dessert.

    <h1>Lahori Kulcha</h1>

    <p>
      Lahori kulcha is a popular street food and a specialty of Lahore, a city
      in Pakistan. It is a type of stuffed bread that is known for its unique
      flavor and texture. Lahori kulcha is made from a dough consisting of
      all-purpose flour, yeast, yogurt, salt, and a touch of sugar. The dough is
      allowed to rise, and then small portions are taken and flattened into oval
      or round shapes. The special feature of Lahori kulcha lies in its filling.
      It is typically stuffed with a spicy and tangy mixture made from boiled
      and mashed potatoes, onions, green chilies, cilantro, and a blend of
      aromatic spices. This filling is then sealed inside the dough and baked in
      a tandoor or on a hot griddle until it turns golden brown and develops a
      slightly crispy exterior. Lahori kulcha is often served with a side of
      chole (chickpea curry) and is enjoyed as a hearty and flavorful breakfast
      or snack. The combination of the soft and fluffy bread with the spicy and
      savory filling creates a mouthwatering culinary experience that is loved
      by locals and visitors alike in Lahore.

    <h1>White Karahi</h1>

    <p>
      White karahi is a popular Pakistani dish known for its creamy and
      flavorful taste. It is called "white" karahi because of its creamy white
      appearance. The dish is typically made with boneless chicken or mutton
      cooked in a blend of spices, yogurt, cream, and butter. The flavors of
      garlic, ginger, and green chilies add a delightful kick to the dish. White
      karahi is enjoyed with naan or rice and is a favorite among those who
      prefer a milder yet rich and creamy curry option. The preparation of white
      karahi involves slow cooking the meat with the spices and other
      ingredients until it becomes tender and absorbs the flavors. The creamy
      and smooth texture of the dish comes from the addition of yogurt and
      cream, giving it a luxurious and indulgent taste. White karahi is a
      popular choice for special occasions and gatherings, offering a delicious
      twist to traditional Pakistani cuisine with its creamy and flavorful
      profile.

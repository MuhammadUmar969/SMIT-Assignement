    <p>
      Mutton karahi is a beloved dish in Pakistan that features tender pieces of
      mutton cooked in a rich and flavorful tomato-based gravy. It is a hearty
      and satisfying dish known for its robust flavors. Mutton karahi is
      prepared by saut√©ing onions, ginger, and garlic in oil or ghee until they
      become golden brown. The mutton is then added and cooked until it becomes
      tender and succulent. A mixture of tomatoes, green chilies, and a
      combination of spices such as cumin, coriander, and red chili powder is
      added to create a delicious and aromatic gravy. Mutton karahi is often
      enjoyed with naan or rice, making it a popular choice for special
      occasions and gatherings, showcasing the deliciousness of Pakistani
      cuisine.

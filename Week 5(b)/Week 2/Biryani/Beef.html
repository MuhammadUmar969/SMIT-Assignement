    <h1>Beef Biryani</h1>

    <p>
      Beef biryani is a delectable rice dish that features tender beef and
      fragrant spices. It is a flavorful and satisfying meal enjoyed by meat
      lovers. The dish showcases the perfect harmony of succulent beef, aromatic
      basmati rice, and a blend of spices that create a delightful culinary
      experience. To prepare beef biryani, chunks of beef are often marinated in
      a mixture of yogurt and spices to enhance its tenderness and infuse it
      with flavor. The marinated beef is then cooked with a variety of spices
      like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, along with onions,
      ginger, and garlic, which add depth and richness to the dish. The beef is
      slow-cooked until it becomes tender and juicy, allowing the flavors to
      meld together. In a separate pot, long-grain basmati rice is partially
      cooked with whole spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, which
      impart their aroma to the grains. The partially cooked rice is then
      layered with the cooked beef, and the dish is further garnished with fried
      onions, fresh herbs like mint and coriander, and sometimes nuts like
      cashews or almonds. The layers are cooked together, allowing the flavors
      to meld and the rice to absorb the deliciousness of the beef and spices.
      Beef biryani is a hearty and flavorful dish that is often enjoyed during
      special occasions, family gatherings, and celebrations. Its rich and
      robust taste, combined with the tender beef and fragrant rice, creates a
      satisfying meal that is sure to please any meat lover's palate.

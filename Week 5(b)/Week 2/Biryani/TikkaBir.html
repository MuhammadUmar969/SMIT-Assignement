    <h1>Tikka Biryani</h1>

    <p>
      Tikka biryani is a delicious and flavorful variation of biryani that
      combines the succulence of chicken tikka with aromatic rice. It is a
      popular dish that tantalizes the taste buds with its blend of spices and
      tender chicken tikka pieces. To prepare tikka biryani, boneless chicken
      pieces are marinated in a mixture of yogurt and tikka spices, which
      typically include a combination of paprika, cumin, coriander, ginger,
      garlic, and red chili powder. The marinated chicken is then grilled or
      baked until it is cooked and slightly charred, resulting in juicy and
      flavorful tikka pieces. In a separate pot, fragrant basmati rice is
      partially cooked with whole spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves.
      The partially cooked rice is then layered with the cooked chicken tikka,
      and the dish is further enriched with fried onions, fresh herbs like mint
      and coriander, and a sprinkle of biryani masala. The layers are then
      cooked together on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to
      absorb the essence of the tikka and spices. The result is a mouthwatering
      tikka biryani with tender chicken tikka infused with aromatic spices,
      perfectly complemented by the fragrant and fluffy rice. Tikka biryani is
      often served with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad to balance the
      flavors and provide a refreshing contrast. Tikka biryani is a favorite
      among biryani enthusiasts who enjoy the smoky and bold flavors of chicken
      tikka combined with the richness of biryani. It is a delightful fusion of
      two beloved dishes that guarantees a satisfying and memorable dining
      experience.

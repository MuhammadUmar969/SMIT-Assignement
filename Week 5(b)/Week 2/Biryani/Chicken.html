    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>

    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a popular rice dish made with chicken, rice, and a
      blend of aromatic spices. It is a flavorful and satisfying meal enjoyed by
      people around the world. The dish features long-grain basmati rice that is
      cooked with succulent pieces of chicken, along with a variety of spices
      like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The combination of
      these spices creates a tantalizing aroma and a rich, savory taste. To
      prepare chicken biryani, the chicken is often marinated in a mixture of
      yogurt and spices to enhance its tenderness and infuse it with flavor. The
      marinated chicken is then layered with partially cooked rice, and the dish
      is further garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs like mint and
      coriander, and sometimes nuts like cashews or almonds. The layers are then
      cooked together, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the
      deliciousness of the chicken and spices. Whether enjoyed at festive
      occasions, family gatherings, or as a special treat, chicken biryani is a
      dish that never fails to impress. Its combination of aromatic spices,
      tender chicken, and fragrant rice creates a mouthwatering experience that
      leaves a lasting impression on the taste buds.

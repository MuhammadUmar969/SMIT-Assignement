    <h1>Daal Mash</h1>

    <p>
      Daal mash, also known as white lentil dal, is a flavorful and creamy
      lentil dish commonly enjoyed in South Asian cuisine. It is made from white
      lentils, also known as white urad dal or split urad dal, which have a mild
      and nutty taste. To prepare daal mash, the white lentils are soaked in
      water for a few hours to soften them. Then, they are cooked in a pot with
      water, turmeric, and salt until they become tender and creamy. The lentils
      are simmered on low heat until they reach a smooth and velvety
      consistency. In a separate pan, a tempering mixture is prepared by heating
      oil or ghee and adding cumin seeds, minced garlic, chopped onions, and
      optional spices like ginger, green chilies, and garam masala. Once the
      tempering mixture is fragrant and the onions are caramelized, it is added
      to the cooked lentils, enhancing the flavors of the dish. Daal mash is
      often garnished with fresh coriander leaves and served with rice, naan
      bread, or roti. It is a comforting and nutritious dish, rich in protein
      and fiber. The creamy texture and delicate flavor of daal mash make it a
      popular choice for vegetarian meals or as a side dish to complement other
      main courses. The simplicity and versatility of daal mash allow for
      variations in spice levels and additional ingredients based on personal
      preferences. It is a beloved dish in South Asian households and is enjoyed
      for its comforting taste and nourishing qualities.

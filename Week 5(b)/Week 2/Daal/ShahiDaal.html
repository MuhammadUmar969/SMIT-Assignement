    <h1>Shahi Daal</h1>

    <p>
      Shahi dal, also known as royal lentil curry, is a rich and creamy lentil
      dish that exudes regal flavors. It is a popular dish in Mughlai cuisine,
      known for its indulgent ingredients and aromatic spices. To prepare shahi
      dal, a combination of lentils such as split urad dal (black lentils) and
      chana dal (split Bengal gram) is cooked until they become tender and
      mushy. The cooked lentils are then blended or mashed to achieve a smooth
      consistency. In a separate pan, a rich and flavorful base is created by
      saut√©ing onions, garlic, ginger, and a blend of spices such as cumin,
      coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. This mixture is combined with
      tomato puree or fresh tomatoes and cooked until the flavors meld together.
      The cooked lentils are then added to the base along with cream or milk,
      giving the shahi dal its luxurious and creamy texture. Additional
      ingredients like cashew paste, saffron, or a touch of sugar may be added
      to enhance the richness and sweetness of the dish. Shahi dal is often
      garnished with a drizzle of ghee (clarified butter) and sprinkled with
      fresh coriander leaves, sliced almonds, or fried onions. It is typically
      served with naan bread, rice, or pulao, and is enjoyed as a centerpiece
      dish in special occasions or during festive gatherings. The royal and
      opulent flavors of shahi dal make it a delightful treat for the taste
      buds. Its creamy texture and blend of aromatic spices create a truly regal
      dining experience, capturing the essence of Mughlai cuisine.

    <h1>Daal Chana</h1>

    <p>
      Daal chana, also known as chana dal, is a popular lentil dish in South
      Asian cuisine. It is made from split Bengal gram lentils, which are yellow
      in color and have a mild and nutty flavor. To prepare daal chana, the
      lentils are first soaked in water for a few hours to soften them. Then,
      they are cooked in a pot with water, turmeric, and salt until they become
      tender and creamy. The lentils are typically simmered on low heat until
      they reach the desired consistency. In a separate pan, a tempering mixture
      is prepared by heating oil or ghee and adding cumin seeds, minced garlic,
      and dried red chili peppers. Once the tempering mixture becomes aromatic,
      it is poured over the cooked lentils, adding a burst of flavors. Daal
      chana is often garnished with fresh coriander leaves and served with rice,
      naan bread, or roti. It is a nutritious and protein-rich dish, enjoyed as
      a comforting meal or as a side dish alongside other main courses. The
      combination of creamy lentils, aromatic spices, and the hearty texture of
      daal chana makes it a popular choice in households and restaurants. It is
      a versatile dish that can be customized with additional spices and
      ingredients according to personal taste preferences.

    <h1>Chicken Fried Rice</h1>

    <p>
      Chicken fried rice is a popular and flavorful dish enjoyed in Pakistan. It
      is a delicious combination of cooked rice, tender chicken pieces, and an
      assortment of vegetables, all stir-fried together with aromatic spices and
      sauces. To prepare chicken fried rice, boneless chicken is first marinated
      in a mixture of soy sauce, ginger-garlic paste, and spices to infuse it
      with flavor. The marinated chicken is then cooked until it is tender and
      cooked through. In a separate pan, a medley of vegetables such as carrots,
      peas, bell peppers, and onions are stir-fried until they become
      crisp-tender. The cooked chicken is added to the pan along with cooked
      rice. The entire mixture is tossed together, ensuring that the flavors
      blend well. To add depth and flavor, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and other
      seasonings like black pepper and chili flakes are incorporated into the
      dish. The rice is stir-fried until it is well-coated with the sauces and
      the flavors are evenly distributed. Chicken fried rice is typically
      garnished with fresh green onions or cilantro for added freshness and
      aroma. It can be enjoyed as a standalone meal or served as a side dish
      alongside other Pakistani delicacies. The combination of tender chicken,
      fragrant rice, and vibrant vegetables makes chicken fried rice a
      crowd-pleasing option in Pakistan. Its savory flavors, enticing aroma, and
      satisfying textures make it a go-to choice for a comforting and delicious
      meal.

    <h1>Steam Rice</h1>

    <p>
      Steamed rice, also known as plain boiled rice, is a staple in Pakistani
      cuisine. It is a simple yet essential component of many meals, serving as
      a versatile base for various curries, stews, and other dishes. To prepare
      steamed rice, long-grain rice, such as Basmati rice, is commonly used. The
      rice is thoroughly rinsed with water to remove excess starch, ensuring
      that the cooked grains remain separate and fluffy. The rinsed rice is then
      placed in a pot with the appropriate amount of water, usually using a
      ratio of 1:2 (one part rice to two parts water). The pot is covered with a
      tight-fitting lid and the rice is cooked on low heat until all the water
      is absorbed and the rice is tender. It is important to resist the
      temptation to stir the rice during cooking, as this can lead to a sticky
      texture. Once the rice is cooked, it is left covered for a few minutes to
      allow the steam to finish cooking and to let the grains separate further.
      This resting period helps to achieve perfectly cooked, fluffy rice.
      Steamed rice is a versatile accompaniment to many Pakistani dishes. It can
      be served alongside curries, grilled meats, lentils, or any other
      flavorful main course. Its neutral taste allows it to complement the rich
      flavors of the accompanying dishes. Steamed rice is a beloved part of
      Pakistani cuisine, offering a simple and nourishing carbohydrate base that
      adds balance and satisfaction to a variety of meals.

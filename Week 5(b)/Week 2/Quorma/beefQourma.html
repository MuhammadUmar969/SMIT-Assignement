    <h1>Beef Quorma</h1>

    <p>
      Beef qorma is a delicious and popular dish in Pakistan. It features tender
      beef cooked in a rich and flavorful gravy. The beef is typically marinated
      in a mixture of yogurt and spices to enhance its tenderness and infuse it
      with delicious flavors. To prepare beef qorma, the marinated beef is
      cooked with a blend of aromatic spices, such as cinnamon, cloves,
      cardamom, and cumin. The slow cooking process allows the beef to become
      tender and allows the flavors to meld together, creating a rich and
      flavorful gravy. The qorma gravy is often enriched with ingredients like
      caramelized onions, garlic, and ginger, which add depth to the dish.
      Additionally, tomato paste and a touch of cream may be added to give the
      gravy a creamy and luscious texture. Beef qorma is a hearty and satisfying
      dish that is typically enjoyed with naan, rice, or roti. It is a popular
      choice for festive occasions and family gatherings, as it offers a
      delicious and comforting meal option. The combination of tender beef,
      aromatic spices, and a flavorful gravy makes beef qorma a delightful
      choice for meat lovers. Its rich taste and savory flavors make it a
      beloved dish in Pakistani cuisine.

    <h1>Caramel Custard</h1>

    <p>
      Caramel custard, also known as caramel flan or cr√®me caramel, is a classic
      dessert loved for its smooth texture and rich caramel flavor. It is a
      delightful combination of creamy custard and a luscious caramel sauce. To
      make caramel custard, a caramel sauce is prepared by melting sugar until
      it caramelizes and turns a golden brown color. The caramel is then poured
      into a baking dish or individual ramekins, coating the bottom to create a
      sweet and sticky base. Next, a custard mixture is prepared by combining
      eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. The mixture is gently whisked
      until well combined and smooth. The custard mixture is then poured over
      the caramel in the baking dish or ramekins. The dish is then placed in a
      water bath and baked in the oven until the custard is set but still
      slightly jiggly in the center. Once baked, the caramel custard is cooled
      and refrigerated to chill and set further. When ready to serve, the
      custard is inverted onto a serving plate, allowing the caramel sauce to
      flow over the custard, creating a beautiful and delicious presentation.
      The smooth and silky custard contrasts wonderfully with the sweet and
      sticky caramel, creating a delightful balance of flavors and textures.
      Caramel custard is often enjoyed chilled and can be garnished with a
      drizzle of additional caramel sauce or a sprinkle of grated chocolate or
      nuts for added decoration and flavor. This classic dessert is loved for
      its simplicity and elegance. Its creamy custard and decadent caramel sauce
      create a delightful combination that is sure to satisfy any sweet tooth.
      Whether enjoyed on its own or as a finale to a special meal, caramel
      custard is a timeless treat that is cherished by dessert enthusiasts
      worldwide.
